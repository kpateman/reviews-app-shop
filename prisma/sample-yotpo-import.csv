1001,"product","Published",5,"Absolutely incredible board","I've been snowboarding for eight years and this is without question the best board I've ridden. The edge hold on hardpack is superb and it handles off-piste beautifully. Arrived fast and well packaged. Highly recommend.","2024-11-14","Jake Morrison","jake.morrison@example.com","the-3p-fulfilled-snowboard","The 3p Fulfilled Snowboard",9121098793214,"ORD-44821","verified_buyer","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1418662589339-364ad47f98a2?fm=jpg&q=60&w=3000",
1002,"product","Published",5,"Upgraded and loving it","Finally made the jump from a beginner board and the difference is staggering. So much more responsive and the build quality is clearly a step up. Took it to Val d'Isère last week and it handled everything.","2024-12-03","Sophie Hartley","sophie.hartley@example.com","the-3p-fulfilled-snowboard","The 3p Fulfilled Snowboard",9121098793214,"ORD-44956","verified_buyer","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584890131712-18ee8e3ed49c?fm=jpg&q=60&w=3000",
1003,"product","Published",4,"Great board — re-wax before first use","Really happy with this purchase. Performance is excellent once you're dialled in — took one full day to adjust from my old board. Only suggestion: don't rely on the factory wax, give it a fresh coat before you head out.","2025-01-08","Ben Cartwright","ben.cartwright@example.com","the-3p-fulfilled-snowboard","The 3p Fulfilled Snowboard",9121098793214,,"regular",,
1004,"product","Published",5,"Rips groomers and loves powder","Versatile doesn't cover it. This board is genuinely brilliant in every condition I've thrown at it this season. The twin shape means I can ride switch all day without a second thought. Photos are from a bluebird day in Morzine.","2025-01-22","Isla Douglas","isla.douglas@example.com","the-3p-fulfilled-snowboard","The 3p Fulfilled Snowboard",9121098793214,"ORD-45234","verified_buyer","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1625154869776-100eba31abbb?fm=jpg&q=60&w=3000;https://plus.unsplash.com/premium_photo-1708834155836-4eec278332b6?fm=jpg&q=60&w=3000",
1005,"product","Published",3,"Good board but check the width","Performance is solid and it carves well. However if you have size 9 boots or narrower, be aware the waist width runs quite generous — there's more overhang than I'd ideally want. Hasn't caused issues on the slope but worth knowing before you buy.","2025-02-01","Danny Cole","danny.cole@example.com","the-3p-fulfilled-snowboard","The 3p Fulfilled Snowboard",9121098793214,,"regular",,
2001,"site_review","Published",5,"Best snowboard shop online","I've tried most of the big names and this shop genuinely stands out. Huge range, prices that are actually competitive, and delivery that puts most retailers to shame. My full setup arrived in two days perfectly packaged. Already planning next season's upgrade.","2024-10-18","Tom Dawson","tom.dawson@example.com",,,,,"regular","https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518085050105-3c33befa5442?fm=jpg&q=60&w=3000",
2002,"site_review","Published",5,"Five seasons and still my go-to","Board, boots, bindings, helmet, goggles — all from here across the past five winters. Not a single issue across any order. The loyalty is earned through consistent prices, fast shipping and genuine product knowledge. Wouldn't shop anywhere else.","2024-11-29","Dan Foster","dan.foster@example.com",,,,"ORD-44102","verified_buyer",,
2003,"site_review","Published",4,"Great shop with knowledgeable team","Spent a good chunk of time on live chat choosing between two boards for my riding style and the team were brilliant — patient, specific and clearly knew what they were talking about. The board they recommended is perfect. Knocked one star only because delivery took an extra day.","2025-01-15","Lauren Webb","lauren.webb@example.com",,,,,"regular",,
